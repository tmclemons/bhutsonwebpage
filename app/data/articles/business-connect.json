I maintained regular communication with our partner by providing weekly updates about the status of the project. In the project manager position, I organized team meetings and delegated strategy and responsibility within the team.",

				"In the summer of 2015, the City of Jackson became one of 25 cities nationwide to win a $50,000 grant through the Startup In A Day Competition. This initiative, sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration, aims to facilitate solutions that let entrepreneurs discover and apply for local, state, and federal requirements, such as licenses and permits, in order to start a business within one business day.",
				"The City of Jackson is equipped with resources to encourage small business development, such as extensive vacant commercial and industrial spaces available for future businesses and reduced licensing regulations for certain industries. There are currently 190 existing businesses in the downtown area, and there has been a steady demand for obtaining permits, resources, and licenses for small businesses within the last three years."
			],
			"problem": "The current process to start a business in the City of Jackson is highly disorganized. Outside of their own independent research across a range of websites, entrepreneurs will first go to City Hall’s ground floor to ask questions of available staff. The City’s Economic Development Division has one Economic Development Director, and with limited staff, it is difficult for entrepreneurs to get optimal assistance. To receive further counseling or to obtain relevant forms, entrepreneurs are directed from City Hall to the Jackson County Chamber of Commerce (JCCC) and then to the Small Business Development Center (SBDC), which is a 45 minute drive away in Ann Arbor. Problems with this current process are as follows:",
			"detail": [
				"No central hub exists to find permits and licenses needed specific to business industry",
				"Application forms cannot be submitted online and PDF scans must be printed and completed offline",
				"There is no timeline for processing of applications",
				"It is taxing and time-consuming for entrepreneurs to track progress, get feedback, and follow-up on applications."
			],
			"solution": "To address these issues, the City of Jackson will use their $50,000 grant to create Business Connect, a centralized online platform to streamline business startup in Jackson."

        "To begin, our team conducted interviews with stakeholders to gain more context about the problem. We first had a meeting with the Vice Mayor to learn more about the problem, his goals, and his expectations of the team.",
        "We then met with two additional stakeholders: The City of Jackson’s Economic Development Director and the Executive Director of the Jackson County Chamber of Commerce. Next, the team hosted a focus group with representatives from the Small Business Development Center, area banks, and supporters and members of the Jackson small business community.",
        "During the focus group, we gathered additional information about the current process for obtaining materials to start a business, and to brainstorm possible solutions through Business Connect. We learned that in addition to having difficulty finding and comprehending the required forms, entrepreneurs also had difficulty completing important and helpful milestones crucial for starting a business, such as a business plan.",
        "We also conducted interviews with current business owners about their experience in starting a business and to understand their challenges.",
        "The team’s initial solution was to design and complete front-end development for a business portal. This business portal would include a shopping cart feature, in which the user could search for the forms they need, drag and drop them into a shopping cart, and receive a total price and a timeline for when they could expect their forms to be accepted by the respective government institution. The portal would also provide a step-by-step guide for starting a business. The guide outlined 8 steps in the following order:"

The features of the proposed Business Connect website are as follows:"

				"A zoning map of the city to helps users plan the best location for their business",
				"Links to permits, licenses, and forms at the city, county, state, and federal levels",
				"Three examples of popular business industries and a breakdown of the permits/licenses needed, the agency from where to obtain the form and a timeline for acceptance",
				"A “Featured Business” section where users can read profiles and watch videos of successful local entrepreneurs to inspire users and encourage mentorship between entrepreneurs."

				"Through this studio-based course,  we had conversations reflecting on issues like civic technology, design and innovation, collaboration with local government and communities, adopting new technology, and sustainability.  This project was challenging in that this was the first time I was conducting research and devising the concept and design of a new online system that is schedule to be developed within a year. I also gained additional experience in project management, which was different compared to the project management technique I utilized as an editor. I appreciate that this project taught me to think beyond the design. It taught me to think about a design’s lifecycle and its long-term feasibility, as well as how it will affect the intended user(s) and stakeholder(s)."
